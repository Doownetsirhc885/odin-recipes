        <h1>Watermelon Lemon Sorbet</h1>

        <p>     Sorbet is a refreshing frozen dessert known for its light, fruity flavors
           and smooth, icy texture. Unlike ice cream, sorbet is dairy-free, made primarily 
           from fruit puree or juice mixed with sugar and water. This results in a texture
           that is intensely fruity and slightly icy, akin to a frozen fruit slush. Making 
           sorbet at home is remarkably easy, especially in the summertime when fresh fruits
           are abundant. All it takes is blending together your favorite fruits (like 
           strawberries, mangoes, or lemons) with sugar syrup and a splash of lemon juice 
           for brightness. Once blended, simply freeze the mixture until solid, occasionally
           stirring to prevent large ice crystals from forming. The simplicity of sorbet lies 
           in its minimal ingredients and no-churn method, making it a delightful and cooling 
           treat perfect for hot summer days.

             <li>4 cups cubed seedless watermelon (about 1 small watermelon)</li>
             <li>1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (about 3-4 lemons)</li>
             <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar (adjust according to the sweetness of your watermelon)</li>

        <p><strong>How to Make Watermelon Lemon Sorbet</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Prepare the Watermelon:
                Cut the watermelon into small cubes, removing any seeds. You should have 
                about 4 cups of cubed watermelon.</li>
              <li>Blend the Ingredients:
               In a blender or food processor, combine the cubed watermelon, fresh lemon
               juice, granulated sugar, and lemon zest (if using). Blend until smooth and the sugar is completely dissolved.
                </li>
              <li>Blend the Ingredients:
                In a blender or food processor, combine the cubed watermelon, fresh lemon
                juice, granulated sugar, and lemon zest (if using). Blend until smooth and 
                the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
              <li>Chill the Mixture:
                Transfer the blended mixture to a bowl or container and refrigerate for at 
                least 1-2 hours, until thoroughly chilled. Chilling helps the sorbet freeze
                faster and improves the texture.</li>
              <li>Churn the Sorbet:
                Once chilled, pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according 
                to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, this takes about 20-25 
                minutes until the sorbet reaches a soft-serve consistency.</li>
              <li>Freeze the Sorbet:
                Transfer the churned sorbet into a freezer-safe container. Smooth the top 
                with a spatula, cover tightly with a lid or plastic wrap directly on the 
                surface of the sorbet to prevent ice crystals from forming.</li>
              <li>Freeze Until Firm:
                Allow the sorbet to freeze for at least 4 hours or overnight until firm.
                </li>
              <li>Serve: Before serving, let the sorbet sit at room temperature for a few 
                minutes to soften slightly. Scoop into bowls or glasses and garnish with 
                fresh mint leaves or lemon slices if desired.</li>
              
           
            </ol>
            
            Tips:
            Sweetness: Adjust the amount of sugar based on the sweetness of your watermelon and your personal preference.
            Variations: You can experiment with other citrus fruits like lime or orange instead of lemon for different flavor variations.
            Storage: Store any leftover sorbet in the freezer, covered tightly, for up to 2 weeks. Allow it to soften for a few minutes at room temperature before scooping.
